# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard
End-to-end Bank Loan Analytics project built with SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. Includes KPI summaries, good vs bad loan analysis, regional and trend insights, borrower profiling, and detailed loan-level views to support monitoring, risk assessment, and data-driven lending decisions.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Bank Loan Analytics and Reporting solution using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. The goal is to provide clear visibility into loan performance, borrower behavior, and overall portfolio health through well-defined KPIs and interactive dashboards.

The project is designed from a business perspective, helping stakeholders monitor lending trends, assess risk, and make data-backed decisions.

## Problem Statement

The lending team lacks a centralized reporting system to track key loan metrics, repayment behavior, and portfolio quality. Due to the absence of structured KPIs and visual analytics, it is difficult to evaluate performance, identify risk patterns, and monitor trends over time.

This project addresses that gap by delivering summary, overview, and detailed dashboards that consolidate critical loan data into actionable insights.
